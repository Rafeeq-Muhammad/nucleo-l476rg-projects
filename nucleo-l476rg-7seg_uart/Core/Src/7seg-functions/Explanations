/* I'm using the term "digit place" to refer to the location where some character can be represented.
	 *
	 * **NOTICE**
	 *
	 * So, according to the datasheet we will need to pass with one bit of data or two bits of data
	 * depending on the command we wish to transmit through SPI. As you can see later on in the actual
	 * code you'll notice a few things:
	 *
	    //move cursor to first position 0x00
	    HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOB, GPIO_PIN_6, GPIO_PIN_RESET);
	    HAL_SPI_Transmit(&hspi1, digit1_cmd, 2, timeout);
	    HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOB, GPIO_PIN_6, GPIO_PIN_SET);
	    //write to display "T"
	    HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOB, GPIO_PIN_6, GPIO_PIN_RESET);
	    HAL_SPI_Transmit(&hspi1, &data_buff_1, 1, timeout);
	    HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOB, GPIO_PIN_6, GPIO_PIN_SET);


	  * The SPI transmit has the following syntax: HAL_SPI_Transmit(object address to SPI, data to be transfered, how many bits we are transferring, timeout)
	  * To move the cursor we need to pass 2 bits of data, that is according to the data sheet  {0x79, 0x00}. We cannot just simply
	  * do two HAL SPI Transmit with one transmitting 0x79 and then another one 0x00. We must make an array that carries both bits of data
	  * as defined above. Otherwise the command will not work.
	  *
	  * The reason why we send 1 bit of data to write to the display is because once we indicated what cursor we wanted to be on,
	  * all we have to do is fill its register with some information, in this example its "T". so we pass the address of the data buffer
	  * that contains that character.
	  *
	  * TDLR and simplest terms:
	  *
	  * To send two bytes of data to execute some command according to the data sheet for this display device:
	  * *****YES********

	    HAL_SPI_Transmit(&hspi1, digit1_cmd, 2, timeout);
	    HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOB, GPIO_PIN_6, GPIO_PIN_SET);
	  * This will work to move cursor

   * The way transmission works is I reset the signal to the gpiob making it 0,
   * then I load the information, then i set the signal again to display the signal.
   * The problem is that everytime I set the signal, the cursor moves automatically.
   *
   * SO I HAVE ONE OPTIONS.
   *
   * ONE: Everytime right befor I transmit I manually send the cursor back to the
   * cursor I'm on with the 3 lines I have (DO THIS).
